# Basic Movement

<!-- embed-{$PATH} -->


Learn simple directional movement and fundamental player controls.

## What You'll Learn

- Basic 2D movement mechanics
- Velocity and position manipulation
- Input-based movement control
- Movement smoothing and acceleration

## Interactive Demo

This demo shows basic movement techniques including:
- Arrow key or WASD movement
- Smooth acceleration and deceleration
- Movement boundaries and constraints
- Speed adjustment and control

## Key Concepts

- **Velocity**: Speed and direction of movement
- **Delta Time**: Frame-independent movement
- **Input Handling**: Converting input to movement
- **Boundaries**: Keeping objects within game area

## Next Steps

- Advanced: [Platformer Movement](../platformer_movement/) for jump mechanics
- Alternative: [Top-Down Movement](../top_down_movement/) for different perspectives
