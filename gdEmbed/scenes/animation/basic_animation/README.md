This demo shows basic animation techniques including:
- Moving objects with keyframes
- Scaling and rotation animations
- Color transitions
- Basic animation timing

## Key Concepts

- **Keyframes**: Points in time where property values are defined
- **Interpolation**: How values change between keyframes
- **Animation Player**: Godot's built-in animation system
- **Timeline**: Visual representation of animation sequences

## Next Steps

- Explore [Tweening & Easing](../tweening/) for smooth transitions
- Learn [Animation State Machines](../state_machines/) for complex logic
