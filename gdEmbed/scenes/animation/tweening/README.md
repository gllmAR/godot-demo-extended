# Tweening & Easing

<!-- embed-{$PATH} -->


Learn smooth transitions and easing functions for polished animations.

## What You'll Learn

- Advanced Tween system with real-time controls
- Multiple easing types and transition curves
- Parallel animation techniques
- Visual curve representation
- Interactive animation parameter adjustment

## Interactive Demo

This comprehensive tweening demo demonstrates:

### Features
- **6 Easing Types**: Linear, Sine, Quart, Quint, Expo, Back
- **4 Transition Modes**: In, Out, In-Out, Out-In
- **Real-Time Controls**: Adjust duration and parameters on-the-fly
- **Visual Feedback**: Progress tracking and curve visualization
- **Parallel Animations**: Multiple simultaneous property tweens
- **Interactive Curves**: See how different easings affect movement

### What's Demonstrated
- **Position Tweening**: Smooth movement between points
- **Scale Animation**: Growing and shrinking effects
- **Rotation Tweening**: Smooth rotational animations
- **Color Transitions**: Smooth color interpolation
- **Curve Visualization**: Real-time easing curve display
- **Progress Tracking**: Animation progress percentage

### Controls
- **Number Keys (1-6)**: Switch between easing types
  - 1: Linear (constant speed)
  - 2: Sine (smooth acceleration/deceleration)
  - 3: Quart (moderate curve)
  - 4: Quint (stronger curve)
  - 5: Expo (exponential curve)
  - 6: Back (overshoot effect)
- **Q/W**: Cycle through transition types (In/Out/In-Out/Out-In)
- **Space**: Start/Stop tween animation
- **Duration Slider**: Adjust animation length (0.1-5.0 seconds)
- **Start/Stop Buttons**: Control animation playback

### Learning Objectives
- Understand different easing mathematical functions
- See visual impact of transition types
- Learn when to use each easing curve
- Master parallel animation techniques
- Experience real-time parameter adjustment

## Key Concepts

- **Tweening**: Smooth interpolation between values over time
- **Easing Functions**: Mathematical curves controlling animation timing
- **Transition Types**: In (slow start), Out (slow end), In-Out (both), Out-In (reverse)
- **Tween Class**: Godot's modern tweening system
- **Parallel Animation**: Multiple properties animating simultaneously
- **Animation Curves**: Visual representation of timing functions
