# Basic Physics

<!-- embed-{$PATH} -->


Learn fundamental physics concepts and force-based interactions.

## What You'll Learn

- Physics bodies and forces
- Mass, velocity, and acceleration
- Friction and air resistance
- Basic physics simulation

## Interactive Demo

This demo shows basic physics including:
- Force-based movement
- Gravity and weight simulation
- Friction and momentum
- Physics-based interactions

## Key Concepts

- **Physics Bodies**: Objects that respond to physics forces
- **Forces**: Push/pull effects on objects
- **Mass**: Object weight affecting physics response
- **Friction**: Resistance to movement

## Next Steps

- Advanced: [Collision Detection](../collision_detection/) for object interactions
- Complex: [Rigid Bodies](../rigid_bodies/) for realistic physics
