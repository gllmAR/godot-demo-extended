<!-- embed-{$PATH} -->


Implement realistic physics with rigid body dynamics and interactions.

## What You'll Learn

- RigidBody2D setup and configuration
- Dynamic body spawning and management
- Gravity, mass, and damping effects
- Force application and impulses
- Real-time physics parameter adjustment

## Interactive Demo

This comprehensive demo demonstrates rigid body physics including:

### Features
- **Multiple Body Types**: Spawn boxes, circles, and capsules
- **Dynamic Parameters**: Adjust gravity, mass, and damping in real-time
- **Force Application**: Click to apply forces, create explosions
- **Visual Feedback**: Velocity vectors and collision indicators
- **Interactive Spawning**: Create bodies at mouse position

### Controls
- **Enter/Space**: Apply force at mouse position
- **X**: Spawn new body at mouse cursor
- **Z**: Cycle through body types (Box/Circle/Capsule)
- **C**: Create explosion force at mouse
- **Sliders**: Adjust gravity, mass, and damping
- **Buttons**: Reset simulation, spawn random bodies, clear all
